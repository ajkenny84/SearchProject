This file describes the layout of SearchProjectIndex.txt so that an outside
program may be written to read/write data to the file.

Line 1 has two entries:
first is the name of the program 'SearchProject' followed by a single space,
second is the version number of the index.
If the program name or the version number do not match then the index file is
assumed to be incorrect or out of date and the file will not be used.

Line 2 has a single integer, the number of files currently indexed.
If there are zero files indexed then line 2 should read 0 and not be blank.

Line 3 should be blank, used as a separator.

Lines 4+ will be the list of files indexed;
[index number]s should start at 0, followed by a single space,
[file path]s should be a fully qualified path, followed by a single space,
and [last modification time]s are standard UNIX time.
All 3 elements are required, using the following format:
[index number] [file path] [last modification time]
[index number] [file path] [last modification time]
[index number] [file path] [last modification time]

The next line after the final file in the index is left blank as a separator.

The final section is a list of the words indexed along with their locations in
each file they are found in;
[word] is the actual word itself, followed by a single space,
[index number] is an index of the file the word is found in, followed by a comma,
[location] is the word number in the document, counting starts at 0.
[index number],[location] may be repeated as many times as a word is found.
Using the following format:
[word] [index number],[location] [index number],[location]...
[word] [index number],[location] [index number],[location]...
[word] [index number],[location] [index number],[location]...
